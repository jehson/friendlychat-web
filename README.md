# Firebase Codelab: FriendlyChat

This repository mainly contains a modified "start" source code, containing changes as I go over the Firebase FriendlyChat codelab exercises. It originally includes start and end versions of the code for Web and Cloud Functions.

To get started open the codelab instructions:
 - [Firebase Web Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/).
 - [Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-cloud-functions/).
